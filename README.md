# 📚 An Exploratory Study Towards Understanding Lambda Expressions in Python

✅ **Accepted at:** [International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383219.3383255)

### 📄 Abstract
Lambda expressions are **anonymous functions** in Python, serving as an alternative to traditional function definitions. They provide a concise, functional-style construct, defined using the `lambda` keyword, and are commonly used across modern programming languages such as **Python, Java 8, and C++11**.

💡 **Why this study?**  
While previous studies have explored lambda expressions in C++ and Java to understand developer adaptability and the benefits of using functional constructs, **no prior work has examined the use of lambda expressions in Python.**  

### 🔍 **Our Study**
- Analyzed **15 GitHub repositories** (out of 760) where Python is the primary language.
- Classified and identified **13 distinct scenarios** where lambda expressions are used.
- Created a **catalog** to help Python developers leverage lambda expressions more effectively and efficiently.

---

### 📊 **Key Findings**
- Lambda expressions are used for a variety of tasks, including inline operations, sorting, filtering, and event handling.
- Our catalog highlights common usage patterns to improve the understanding and adoption of lambda expressions in Python projects.
